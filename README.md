##  Project Overview
 
This project builds a complete time series forecasting system for **Reliance Industries (RELIANCE.NS)** using 10 years of BSE stock data (2015–2024). It covers the full ML pipeline — from raw data collection and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment as a dark-themed interactive web dashboard.
 
The goal was to answer a key question:
 
> *"Which model best predicts BSE stock price movements — in terms of both price accuracy and directional accuracy?"*

##  Key Results
 
| Model | RMSE | MAE | MAPE | Directional Accuracy |
|-------|------|-----|------|----------------------|
| ARIMA | 583.83 | 542.51 | 14.02% | — |
| SARIMA | 952.40 | 894.85 | 22.92% | 57.63% |
| **Prophet** | **175.13** | **152.67** | **3.95%** | 59.32% |
| XGBoost | 801.42 | 734.96 | 18.69% | **71.19%** |
| LSTM | 297.75 | 281.97 | 7.37% | 57.63% |
 
**Key findings:**
- **Prophet** achieved the best price accuracy with just **3.95% MAPE**
-  **XGBoost** predicted market direction correctly **71.19%** of the time — well above the 50% random baseline
-  **LSTM** performed as the best all-rounder with 7.37% MAPE on a univariate Close-price setup
-  SARIMA underperformed — confirming that BSE stocks have weak weekly seasonality

## Feature Engineering
 
The following technical indicators were engineered from raw OHLCV data:
 
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| SMA 7/14/30/50/200 | Simple Moving Averages |
| EMA 7/14/30 | Exponential Moving Averages |
| RSI 14 | Relative Strength Index |
| MACD + Signal | Moving Average Convergence Divergence |
| Bollinger Bands | Upper, Mid, Lower bands (20-day) |
| Lag Features | Close price lagged 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 days |
| Daily Return | Percentage change in Close |
| Volatility 14 | 14-day rolling standard deviation of returns |
| Daily Range | High − Low |
| Volume SMA 14 | 14-day rolling average volume |

##  Model Architecture
 
### LSTM (Fixed)
- Architecture: `LSTM(64) → Dropout(0.2) → LSTM(32) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(16) → Dense(1)`
- Input: 30-day univariate Close price sequences
- Loss: Mean Squared Error
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Callbacks: EarlyStopping (patience=20), ReduceLROnPlateau
### XGBoost
- Estimators: 500 trees, learning rate 0.05, max depth 4
- Features: All 30+ engineered technical indicators
- Regularization: L1 (α=0.1) + L2 (λ=1.0)
- Best use: Directional/momentum prediction
### Prophet
- Mode: Multiplicative seasonality
- Custom seasonality: Quarterly earnings cycle (63 trading days)
- Changepoint prior scale: 0.05
- Best use: Price level forecasting with confidence intervals

## Anomaly Detection
 
Three methods were applied and compared:
 
- **Z-score** — flags returns beyond 3 standard deviations
- **Residual-based** — flags decomposition residuals beyond 3σ
- **Isolation Forest** — multivariate anomaly detection on Close, Volume, Return, Volatility
Top anomaly dates align with real-world events: COVID-19 crash (Mar 2020), RIL rights issue (May 2020), and major quarterly earnings surprises.
